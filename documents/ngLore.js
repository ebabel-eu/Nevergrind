Events:
Imperial Shattering - Global war for racial sovereignty that saw the deaths of millions due to mass ethnic cleansing, food shortages, and disease. Vandamor enjoyed long period of peace and prosperity until increasing  ethnic, religious, and racial tension resulted in both radical political groups and Imperial officers engaged in mass ethnic cleansing, tribal warfare, and, ultimately, sovereign realignment throughout Vandamor. 

Since that time a period of staunch nationalist domestic policy has emerged with increasingly distinct national identities. Yet, a period of relative calm has emerged with nations agreeing to mutually beneficial trade agreements and other forms of diplomacy.
